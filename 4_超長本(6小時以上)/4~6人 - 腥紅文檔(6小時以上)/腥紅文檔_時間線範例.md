制定了關於在特定時間時發生了什麼事情，出於版權原因，這裡不會完全提及劇本內容。  


September 17th, 192X:  
192X 年 9 月 17 日：  
Emilia Court grabs the Papers from Cecil Hunter (or Prof. Leiter) in order to protect them from being sold.  
Emilia Court 從 Cecil Hunter（或 Leiter 教授）手中奪取文檔，以防止它們被出售。  


September 24th, 192X: 
192X 年 9 月 24 日：   
Emilia and a janitor find Prof. Leiter dead.  
艾米莉亞和一名保全發現萊特教授已經死了。


October 1st, 192X:  
192X 年 10 月 1 日： 
12:30 P.M: The investigators meet with Dean Fallon and are explained the situation and given access to the cottage, his office, and the morgue.  
下午 12:30：調查人員與 Dean Fallon 會面並了解情況並獲准進入小屋、他的辦公室和太平間。  

12 P.M. to 2 P.M: Emilia sorting through documents in Leiter’s office and organizing them.
中午 12 點到下午 2 點：艾米莉亞在萊特辦公室處理文件並整理它們。  

4 P.M: Prof. Roach starts to believe Emilia Court has taken the Arkham Witch Trial Papers.  
下午 4 點：Roach 教授開始相信 Emilia Court 已經拿到了 Arkham Witch 審判文件。  

4:30 P.M: Roach and Court argue about where Leiter’s stuff should go and who should take care of it.  
下午 4:30：Roach 和 Court 爭論 Leiter 的東西應該​​去哪里以及應該由誰來處理。  

5 P.M: Roach breaks into Court’s apartment using keys from the school (could also be a women’s dorm instead, which would result in witnesses). Takes the Papers for himself and secures them in his office. Anthony Flinders sees him rushing with some items (the Papers), and sees he is haggard and paranoid.  
下午 5 點：羅奇使用學校的鑰匙闖入法院的公寓（也可能是女性宿舍，這會導致證人出現）。 為自己拿走這些文件並將它們固定在他的辦公室裡。 安東尼弗林德斯看到他拿著一些東西（論文）匆匆忙忙，看到他憔悴和偏執。  

8 P.M: Flinders breaks into Roach’s office through the window and steals the Arkham Witch Trial Papers for himself, leaving behind a good luck charm of his. Could be either a satanic symbol, or an Elder Sign stone he mistook for a satanic symbol. I used an Elder Sign, and added a banishment ritual from papers investigators can find in the Hobbhouse Manse, based on the ‘Banish Byatis’ spell in the grand grimoire. POW is changed to the Horror’s POW of 150 and the statue is changed to a sketch.  
晚上 8 點：弗林德斯從窗戶闖入羅奇的辦公室，為自己偷走了阿卡姆女巫審判文件，留下了他的幸運符。 可能是撒旦符號，也可能是他誤認為是撒旦符號的長老符石。 我使用了一個長者標誌，並根據大魔典中的“放逐比亞蒂斯”咒語，從調查人員可以在霍布豪斯莊園找到的文件中添加了一個放逐儀式。 POW 更改為 150 的恐怖 POW，雕像更改為草圖。  


October 2nd, 192X:  
192X 年 10 月 2 日： 
9 A. M: Roach comes back to find his office broken into and ransacked. Brings the police in and argues with Dean Fallon about the burglar being Court, the Dean having no reason to suspect her leaves it and will tell the investigators.  
Flinders stayed up all night reading the Papers (obviously tired), but still wants to see what the investigators are up to and what they’ve found out.  
上午 9 點：羅奇回來發現他的辦公室被人闖入並被洗劫一空。 帶警察進來並與院長法倫爭論竊賊是法院，院長沒有理由懷疑她離開了它，並將告訴調查人員。
弗林德斯通宵閱讀論文（顯然很累），但仍然想看看調查人員在做什麼以及他們發現了什麼。

12 P.M: Wick uses Hector Fademan to send a note to the investigators, asking them to meet later in the day.  
Signs of Passage begin to ramp up near Flinders. Preferably every hour. Can roll dice to determine which Sign happens.  
Fallon will ask the investigators for an update on the investigation.  
下午 12 點：威克讓赫克托·法德曼給調查人員發了一張便條，要求他們在當天晚些時候見面。
通道的跡像開始在弗林德斯附近增加。 最好每小時一次。 可以擲骰子來確定哪個標誌發生。
法倫將要求調查人員提供調查的最新情況。

3 P.M: Oaks and Shaunassy confront Lucy Stone about Leiter’s debt at Hibb’s Roadhouse.  
4 P.M: Lucy gets into Leiter’s cottage to find the hidden money so she can leave Arkham. She left her resignation at Hibb’s Roadhouse.  
5 P.M: Flinders gets his Papers (from his dorm, house, or otherwise) and travels to Hobbhouse Manse to experiment. Could have him Soul Burn his roommate and drive him insane, requiring police and sanitorium presence.  
Cecil Hunter breaks out of the Asylum, possessed by the Horror, and starts closing in on where the Papers are, desperate to finish his work.  
October 3rd, 192X:  
12 A.M: Horror possesses Hunter, driving Flinders insane. He can be found running from the Manse to Arkham. Carla Fademan could find him (Wick keeping track of the Papers-involved parties, perhaps, or the Manse), bringing him to Wick, possibly to use for the binding ritual if he can get his hands on the Papers. Possibly alerts the investigators.  
6 A.M: Lucy Stone takes an early train to get out of Arkham permanently. Possibly moves to Ipswich.  
7 A.M: Hunter returns to either Leiter’s cottage or his own apartment to finish his work on the forgery. When my investigators heard that he had broken out, they immediately went to the cottage, so I changed the location from Hunter’s apartment to there. Either should work.  
10 A.M: Signs of Passage near either Hunter’s flat or Leiter’s cottage, that are apparent to everyone in Arkham and rising in intensity every hour.  
12 P.M: Fallon will want another update from the investigators.   
Wick sends a message if he took Flinders in.  
Wheatcroft goes missing. The ‘how’ is left to the Keeper, possibly even left unknown.  

A few notes:  
Rolling for Signs of Passage helped me flesh out my timeline and possible events.
Possession should go in order of who had the Papers last, minus the Hunter possession(s).  
Talks of the apparition around Arkham can drive the investigators to specific locations and show them the clock is counting down.
